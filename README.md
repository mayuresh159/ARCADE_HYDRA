# ARCADE_HYDRA

This project contains the Hydra files to monitor telemetry from ARCADE OBC. 
We use the Debug UART port of the OBC to connect to hardline serial port on the HYDRA. It is primarily targeted to conduct TVAC and aliveness tests on the ARCADE satellite and monitor and record the telemetry/ housekeeping data during hardware environmental testing.
For actual flight a separate repository is envisioned.
